# Budget Calculator
This budget calculator is a way for me to learn about developing stuff while making balancing the checkbook a little easier. The idea is to make this something I can continually work on as my skillset expands. Fullstack development, man. 

## Technologies
* Javascript  
* CSS  
* HTML

## Status
Javascript has been added and a lot of the logic is there to make it functional. It mainly uses prompts to get user input so the next stage is using forms and such with html :)
